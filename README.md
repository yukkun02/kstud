    ‚ÄºÔ∏è **IMPORTANT NOTE: Update Alert: Quest 6 got an Upgrade** üéÅ
    - Quest 6 got a facelift‚Äîwith new & clearer instructions and a streamlined workflow update.  To sync these updates into your workspace without disrupting your progress tracking, follow the instructions below to fetch and replace the two key files:
    
    - **Step 1: Run this command in your repo root:**

        _If on Windows:_
        ```shell
        curl.exe -LfO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/JS-AI-Build-a-thon/main/.github/steps/6-build-agent.md
        curl.exe -LfO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/JS-AI-Build-a-thon/main/.github/workflows/6-build-agent.yml
        ```

        Then run:
        ```shell
        mv -Force 6-build-agent.md .github/steps/
        mv -Force 6-build-agent.yml .github/workflows/
        ```

        _If on MacOS:_
        ```shell
        curl -LfO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/JS-AI-Build-a-thon/main/.github/steps/6-build-agent.md
        curl -LfO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/JS-AI-Build-a-thon/main/.github/workflows/6-build-agent.yml
        ```
        Then:
        ```shell
        mv -f 6-build-agent.md .github/steps/
        mv -f 6-build-agent.yml .github/workflows/
        ```

    - **Step 2: Push the 2 updated files on GitHub**

        ```bash
        git add .github/steps/6-build-agent.md .github/workflows/6-build-agent.yml
        git commit -m "Updated Quest 6 instructions"
        git push
        ```
    - **Step 3: If your progress is already on Quest 6 _(You have Quest 6 on your README)_, reset your progress by clicking on the `Reset progres` button at the top of your file. Once on the welcome page, select the `I want to build an AI Agent` Quest**

    Done! The new files are in place
        
    üìå Reminder: Do this before starting Quest‚ÄØ6. You‚Äôll be working with the latest version. Got questions? Drop them in our Discord!
